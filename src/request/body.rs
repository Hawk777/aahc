	///
	/// The `length` parameter is the minimum number of bytes of body that will be sent from this
	/// point forward.
	///
	/// The application must send at least `length` bytes before finishing the request. However, it
	/// is permitted to send *more* than `length` bytes (subject to any other constraints, such as
	/// not sending more than specified in the `Content-Length` header).
	///
	/// For a fixed-length request (e.g. one whose length was set by a `Content-Length` header),
	/// this function does nothing.
	///
	/// For a chunked request, this function sets the size of the next chunk; this allows a large
	/// chunk size to be sent without the entire contents of the chunk needing to be available at
	/// once. For example, if the application knows that the body will contain *at least* another
	/// 100,000 bytes, it could call this function passing a `length` parameter of 100,000, but
	/// then write just 10,000 bytes at a time, ten times over. Without calling this function, that
	/// would result in ten 10,000-byte chunks being sent; by calling this function, a single
	/// 100,000-byte chunk is sent instead, reducing the overhead due to chunk headers, without
	/// requiring that the application load all 100,000 bytes into memory at once.

	/// Finishes the request.
	///
	/// On success, a metadata instance is returned. This instance must be passed in when the
	/// application is ready to receive the response headers.
	///
	/// *Important*: This function does not flush the socket. If the application is going to read a
	/// response, or if the socket is a buffered wrapper around an underlying socket and the
	/// application intends to unwrap the wrapper, it must flush the socket before proceeding to
	/// read the response, otherwise a hang might occur due to the server waiting for the remainder
	/// of the request which will never arrive. If the application intends to send another request
	/// instead, using HTTP pipelining, the flush is not necessary.
	///
	/// # Errors
	/// This function returns an error if writing to the underlying socket fails.
	///
	/// # Panics
	/// This function panics in a debug build:
	/// * if the body has a fixed length and was not fully sent
	/// * if the body is chunked and the most recent chunk was not fully sent
	///
	/// These are debug-build panics, not errors, because it is expected that the application will
	/// provide a request body consistent with the request headers; since both of these things are
	/// under the application’s control, an inconsistency between them represents a bug in the
	/// application.
